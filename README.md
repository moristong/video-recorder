Video Recorder is an extension that helps you easily record videos from your computer camera (i.e. webcam). This web application is particularly useful when there is no native camera recording app on your machine, or you prefer an HTML5 app for recording videos.

Start using the app by pressing on the - Play - button. The first time you run the app, it will ask for the microphone and camera permissions to be able to record videos. Once you are done recording, press on the stop-recording button (right next to the red recording button) to stop the recording. At the end, press on the - Stop - button to turn the camera OFF. You can install this app as a PWA on your mobile device, moreover, it is available as a browser extension as-well-as a web application:
